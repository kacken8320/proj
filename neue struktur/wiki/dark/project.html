		<p><em>The Project</em> is a group of people who voluntarily cohere to a given set of rules. The aim of the Project is to increase the quality of genetic material as well as the overall quality of society. The Project is exclusive to people with certain genetic material, which has to meet specific standards. People may participate, if their genetic material and societal behaviour is sufficient, or may be asked to leave, if their genetic material or societal behaviour is not sufficient.</p>
		<p>Notably in these rules is the decision wether a new born child of two participants is being offered a participant status or not, this decision is based on the genetic material. This way, a <em>selective selection</em> is given. Participants are free to leave the Project whenever they want, and there are comprehensive reentry-programs and communities for those who decide to leave. This is important as the participant status can be lost in a multitude of ways, and is done to ensure a safe exit, as well as a quick reentry in the <em>non-participating</em> society, for those who leave.</p>

		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>First writings of the Project appeared around 2022 when the Project lead sat on a train. Some people were loud, drinking and listening to music, disturbing the peace and not considering the other passengers on the train. This motivated the Project lead to write down first ideas on how to increase the quality of genetic material, as well as build a society that roots out bad behaviour in an evolutionary fashion.</p>

		<h2>Futility</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>As the main idea of the project is to increase the quality of genetic material, it is, since the first writings, utterly and completely futile. Genetic manipulation exists since 1990. </p>
