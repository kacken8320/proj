		<p>Bath houses in the Project historically were centres for hygiene, cleanliness, and social gatherings. Today, they primarily serve as wellness spaces while continuing to be social meeting places, featuring baths, showers, and saunas. Until today, bath houses are viewed as microcosms of the Projects society. The bath house is one of many social spaces where the participating values are reflected and baselined.</p>

		<h2>Societal perception</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Bathing in the Project is both a social ritual and a cultural expectation. Participants are not strictly required to bathe, but it is a societal norm and habit to visit the bath houses roughly every one to two weeks. Bathing is communal: nudity is expected, but men and women are strictly separated. The visual equality created by mutual nudity reflects the established, project-wide value of equality and acts as a foundation for it. Bath houses are free spaces, yet highly regulated by societal norms. Those who break the house rules face social disapproval and may be asked to leave. By providing a shared environment, mutual respect is strengthened, social cohesion lifted and the habitual recognition of equality among all participants is provided. Collective bathing maintains the feeling of community as the community maintains collective bathing. </p>

		<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The infrastructure is actually built by the project.</p>
		<article id="demographic-and-regional-distribution">
			<h3>Demographical and regional distribution</h3>
			<p>In general, there is roughly one bath house per 1000 participants, ensuring convenient access for all citizens. This number may be exceeded if certain participants take longer than five minutes to the next bath house.</p>
		</article>
		<section id="layout-and-architecture">
			<h3>Layout and Architecture</h3>
			<p>Bath houses are not built identically or in series. The interiors use a combination of natural and engineered materials like wood, stone, and glass, as well as concrete, ceramic, terracotta, marble or granite, bamboo, metals, and plaster, all treated to withstand moisture. Many bath houses incorporate regional characteristics and variations, influenced by geographic location, ethnicity, traditions and culture. This can include traditional arthitecture, plants, artwork, mosaics, patterns, or motifs unique to the region. Such decorations not only reflect the heritage and identity of the local population but also create a sense of place and community within the bath house. However, each bath house contains:</p>
			<section id="entrance">
				<h4>Entrance</h4>
					<p>The entrances feature automatic detection of number of guests. This is due to planning bath house peak times and overall demographic statistics. Shoes are removed in the very beginning and are replaced by slippers which the participants bring themselves, as is the norm in every project facility. Modesty is preserved until the changing rooms.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="changing-rooms">
				<h4>Changing rooms</h4>
					<p>Seperation of men and women start here in the changing rooms (except for the entrance and the <a href="#childrens-bath">childrens bath</a>), the genders are seperated everywhere from here on out. The changing rooms are kept open and don't feature single booths. Everyone changes together and proceeds to the storage rooms.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="storage-rooms">
				<h4>Storage rooms</h4>
					<p>The rooms are to be entered fully nude. The storage rooms feature open, wooden shelves to put ones belongings. Nothing in the storage room is being locked, as everyone is contempt with what they have and no one has something, that someone else needs. Participants leave <em>everything</em> in the storage rooms except for a towel.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="showers">
				<h4>Showers</h4>
					<p>Before entering any baths, every participant showers thoroughly. Soap is used only for cleaning the genitals, while the rest of the body is rinsed with water alone. Showers are taken with hot or warm water, followed by a cold rinse, in keeping with the standard bathing practice in the Project. After showering, participants enter either the baths or saunas.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="baths">
				<h4>Baths</h4>
					<p>There is a multitude of baths in each bath house. They feature:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lap pool - <em>for excercise, featuring long straight lines</em></li>
						<li>Hot mineral bath - <em>for relaxation, recovery and longevity</em></li>
						<li>Warm saltwater bath - <em>for relaxation, buoyancy, and skin care</em></li>
						<li>Hot jet stream bath - <em>for massage and muscle relief</em></li>
						<li>Cold bath - <em>to stimulate circulation</em></li>
						<li>Carbonated bath - <em>lightly fizzy water to improve circulation and relax muscles</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Every day, two of these baths are "silent" baths for relaxation, and the rest remain "societal" for socializing. As they are seperated by gender, each gender has access to one <em>silent</em> bath amd two <em>societal</em> baths. These circualte on a regular schedule.</p>
					<p>The lighting in the bath house represents the current color and brightness of the sun. During the evening and night, flickering lantern-style lights cast a warm yellow-orange glow throughout the bath house, gently signaling the transition to night and creating a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.</p>
					<section id="childrens-bath"></section><p>Most bath houses also feature a unisex childrens bath for playing. These baths feature a life guard so children can safely play while the parents relax. The childrens bath is an exception to nudity as everyone must wear proper swimwear. Parents may accompany their children here. Children may also enter baths for their gender, provided they are accompanied by their parent of the same sex.</p></section>

		<article id="cleanliness-by-design">
			<h3>Cleanliness by design</h3>
			<p>Bath houses follow a cleanliness-by-design principle. Floors, walls, and surfaces are made smooth and from water-resistant, easy-to-clean materials. Minimal seams and joints prevent dirt accumulation, including at wall-wall, wall-floor, and wall-ceiling edges.</p>
			<p>Sloped floors automatically drain water into central channels, and high-contact areas feature automatic water flow to rinse surfaces. The open layout ensures dirt is easily visible, and lighting is maintained to avoid hiding any contamination.</p>
			<p>During closing hours, ozone generators release controlled amounts of ozone to oxidize bacteria and viruses without leaving chemical residues. Lights shift to complete white during cleaning to reveal dirt, and to UV lights to sterilize surfaces, killing bacteria, viruses, and mold spores.</p>
			<p>Both the ozone and UV systems are automated and scheduled to run without human intervention. Regular staff inspections verify the systems function correctly and ensure the bath houses remain exceptionally clean.</p>
